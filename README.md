A University Campus network designed in Cisco Packet Tracer.
This project aims to design a redundant and efficient campus network using Cisco Packet 
Tracer. The network will serve a small educational institution with multiple departments, 
each requiring access to shared resources like printers and the internet. The network will 
utilize a range of protocols, including RSTP, VLANs, HSRP, Layer 2 and Layer 3 
EtherChannels, OSPF/EIGRP, DNS, DHCP, NAT and PAT, NTP, FTP, syslog, SNMP, SSH, LLDP.
